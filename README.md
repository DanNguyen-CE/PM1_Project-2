## Mock Stock & Bank System

> Grade: A+

```
Code By: Daniel Nguyen - 173005214
Course: Programming Methodology I
Professor: Yangyong Zhang

Description:
In this project, I was asked to write a system which models a stock market and bank account using
the C++ class features including inheritence. I must be able to sell and buy stocks which were randomized
between 4 stock.txt files which contains different stock prices but the same stock names. It must be able
to display the current portfolio and also contain basic banking features such as withdrawing and depositing.
This must then be saved on a .txt file where I can acess and display the transaction history when
called for.
