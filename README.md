Code By: Daniel Nguyen - 173005214
Course: Programming Methodology I
Professor: Yangyong Zhang

Description:
In this project, I was asked to write a system which models a stock market and bank account using
the C++ class features including inheritance. I must be able to sell and buy stocks which were randomized
between 4 stock.txt files that contains different stock prices but the same stock names. It must be able
to display the current portfolio and also contain basic banking features such as withdrawing and depositing.
All transactions must then be saved on a .txt file where I can access and display it when called for.
